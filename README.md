# mom-utils
Set of utilities I make to help me help my mom


## Note
The files which aren't in folders are simple enough to not need any additional packages and can be run seperately by running those files (I might have them as `.exe` later, it's literally one line of code but lol nope) . And those which are within folders do need additional setup, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you see `requirements.txt` but anything other than that, I **might** have a seperate README.md for it `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
