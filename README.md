# mom-utils
Set of utilities I make to help me help my mom


## Note
The files which aren't in folder are simple enough to not need any additional packages and can be run seperately by running those files (I might have them as .exe later, it's literally one line of code but lol nope) . And those which are within folders do need additional setup, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you see requirements.txt but anything other than that, I **might** have a seperate README.md for it `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
