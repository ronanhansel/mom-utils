#Adding folders to google drive with ease

Aight folks, this requires a bit more of coding (not really, just configuring)

Firstly setup the API for Google Drive, this might be troublesome but life is fun when its aint easy.
Follow [this](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api "SUPER GUIDE") tutorial to configure the API, you should add your email address to the Test Users to allow yourself to access the API

Next, just download the **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** credentials and save it in this folder as `credentials.json`
. That's it, you're the owner of this handy tool now, dont forget to install the requirements

Also when you run `main.py` for the first time, a new file named token.pickle will be created, don't delete it or you will have to go through the verification process again.
